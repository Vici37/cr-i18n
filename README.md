# Crystal Internationalization (I18n)

This shards aims to provide a simple interface for obtaining the correct label of a specified language and locale.

This shard does not translate anything, only organizes any labels from multiple languages and locales, so obtaining the correct label
is more streamlined.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cr-i18n:
       github: vici37/cr-i18n
   ```

2. Run `shards install`
